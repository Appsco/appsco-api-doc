# REST API

The REST APIs provide programmatic access to read and write Appsco data.  
Create new dashboard, list all applications on specific dashboard, retrieve users assigned to dashboard, and more.   

The REST API identifies Appsco users using [OAuth 2](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749); responses are available in JSON.
